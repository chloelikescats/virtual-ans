Welcome to Virtual ANS, a virtual model of the ANS Synthesizer, a Soviet era visual synthesizer which translates images into sound. As there is only one ANS synthesizer in existence, I wanted to create an accessible simulation. Using Python's Pillow library to analyze pixel data, and Flocking, a generative audio synthesis library for JavaScript, the Virtual ANS enables to draw or upload images and produce sonic compositions based on their visual characteristics. Uploaded images are moderated using the SightEngine API in order to reduce content inappropriate for all ages of users. Registered users are able to upload images, save drawings, and favorite images in a public image library for faster access and playback.
